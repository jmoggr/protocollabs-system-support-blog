title: Production Website Down
---

Oh no! A user is having a problem! The first step is to write an introduction. On second thought, clear and open communication with the user should always be a top priority when helping users solve problems with your software. This helps build trust with your users and makes the problem-solving process easier.

This article will feature a scenario where the user has just informed you that a production website is down, the goal is to help guide you through the problem-solving process while highlighting communication with users.

For this scenario, first determine if there is an ongoing outage, either for the whole service or for certain availability zones. If any part of the service is down, then move to incident management, otherwise work with the user to debug their access to your service.


### Debugging users

If the website is down for the user, connect with that user and walk through the troubleshooting process with them. Simple things like making sure that the user has the correct address for the website and that they are connected to the internet should be considered.

If the problem persists, it may be appropriate to loop in IT resources available to the user to run through a more technical debugging session. This could include checking that relevant ports are not blocked and that the website domain name is available on the user’s DNS servers


### Incident management

Incident management can take many forms, so teams should have a tailored plan in place. No matter how different incident management plans may be, communicating with users should always play an important role. Below are some examples of when and what to communicate to users during an incident response.

When an outage has been identified:
- Communicate to the users that there is an outage and that there’s a team working on it

When the problem has been identified and a solution planned:
- Communicate to the users that the problem has been identified and include an ETA on a fix

When service has been restored:
- Communicate to the users that the problem has been resolved

When a post-mortem has been completed:
- Publish a high-level overview of the post-mortem and the plan to prevent similar outages in the future.


## Conclusion

While helping a user with any problem it is important to empathize with the user. Simply understanding the impact an outage has on a user can go a long way to ameliorating the situation for the user. At the very least clear and open communication with a user while assisting them with a problem is an opportunity to strengthen the working relationship with the user.
