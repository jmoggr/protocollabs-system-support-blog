Hi! My name is Jason.

I'm currently the technical lead of a small team developing a financial reporting tool. I enjoy reading, writing, and learning new technologies. Currently, I am learning Rust and attempting to get my desktop to run on NixOS. My favorite flavor of crayon is orange, thanks for asking.

As a nerd I have always been interested in the technical underpinnings of decentralized systems and the applications built on them. I would describe myself as a crypto-moderate: skeptical of the current applications, but excited by the possibilities enabled through a distributed ledger. Recently I have been interested in the application of decentralized systems for improving governance. I am excited by the possibility of discovering new applications for distributed technologies that have a meaningful positive impact on the world.
